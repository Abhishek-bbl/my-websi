      <h2 class="scene-title">🌄 The Ride Begins</h2>

      <p class="scene-text">
        It all started with a 48 km ride to Almatti... I was in my favorite shirt — sleeves folded, untucked — the usual charm I save just for her.
        <br /><br />
        And there she stood, waiting even before I reached — her face gently veiled by the brown kurta’s dupatta, eyes shining, clutching her little backpack like it held all her secrets.
      </p>

      <p class="scene-text highlight">
        The moment our eyes met... the world slowed down. Everything else blurred into the background.
      </p>

      <p class="scene-text animated-hold">
        She climbed onto the bike, without a word — just a quiet smile. Her arms didn’t wrap around me completely... instead, her hand softly rested on my shoulder.
        <br /><br />
        And as the road beneath us broke into humps and turns, her grip tightened — each little squeeze saying things we never dared to speak. In those moments, it wasn’t just her hand… it was her trust, her presence, her love — holding on to me.

      <h2 class="scene-title">🍽️ Breakfast & Butterflies</h2>

      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 0.5s;">
        We reached Bagalkot and stopped at Pakwan — the same old hotel, but this time... it felt different.
      </p>

      <p class="scene-text highlight fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 1s;">
        “These water bottles are so weird,” she whispered, looking at the label. I just smiled — her voice made everything else feel so quiet.
      </p>

      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 1.5s;">
        While she spoke, I secretly texted my friend to bring a surprise — two roses, a KitKat, and a gift she’d never expect.
      </p>

      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 2s;">
        But she caught me. Snatched my phone, laughed, and called my aunt randomly. That laugh? It echoed in my heart.
      </p>

      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 2.5s;">
        She slowly pushed her plate toward me and said, “Cut this vada into 8 pieces for me.” That simple ask... meant everything.
      </p>

      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 3s;">
        Her bag’s zip got stuck. We both tried, both failed — and ended up giggling like kids. It wasn’t about the zip. It was about us.

      <h2 class="scene-title">🎁 The Gift Surprise & Stroll</h2>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 0.5s;">
        Just outside the hotel, my friends walked in — carrying a college bag. Inside it? The surprise I had secretly planned: 
        <strong>2 roses, a KitKat, and a gift I’d kept safe for a year.</strong>
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 1s;">
        I introduced Sneha to them with the biggest smile. She stood there — calm, soft, and sweet — and my heart? Proud. That moment felt like a flex I’d waited years for.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 1.5s;">
        We didn’t open the bag just yet. Instead, we walked together to a nearby gift center — like a couple lost in their own tiny world.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 2s;">
        She scanned shelves of pen stands and incense burners. Nothing felt right... until the next shop across the road. There, she finally chose a pen stand and a backflow incense burner. I paid. She smiled. And in that moment, I melted.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 2.5s;">
        We kept the items in my bag and continued — window shopping a bit more before heading to a cosmetic store. She picked conditioner and moisturizer while I watched her glow under soft lights ✨
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text animated-hold" style="animation-delay: 3s;">
        We sat for a while, again trying to fix her stuck zip. Still no luck. But between that laugh, her soft “ugh,” and our fingers brushing — something clicked better than that zip ever would.

      <h2 class="scene-title">👗 The Dress Hunt at Trends</h2>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 0.5s;">
        We reached the Trends showroom, and I walked ahead — opened the glass door like a gentleman. She walked in first, and I followed her, watching the sunlight play with her dupatta.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 1s;">
        We began scanning racks, floor by floor. She looked at a few dresses, but nothing seemed to excite her.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text highlight fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 1.5s;">
        I spotted tiny kids’ slippers and joked, “These might just fit you.” She burst out laughing and gently hit my shoulder.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 2s;">
        On the first floor, she finally liked one dress — but of course, it wasn’t in her size. She sighed and said, “I already have something like this at home anyway.”
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text animated-hold" style="animation-delay: 2.5s;">
        While walking down the stairs, I gently reached over and removed her mask. She looked up with those soft, surprised eyes — and in that second, it was just us.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 3s;">
        No selfies. No crowd. No noise. Just a silent heartbeat kind of moment that still echoes in my head.

      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 0.5s;">
        We walked into Amogham and found a cozy table, just the two of us. It was quiet, peaceful — like the world paused so we could breathe in each other.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 1s;">
        We ordered chicken biryani and a chicken starter — but the food took forever. So I just sat there, looking at her. She caught me a few times... but didn’t mind.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text highlight fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 1.5s;">
        Her eyes kept going to the surprise bag. “What’s in it?” she asked again and again. But I just smiled. Not yet, I thought. Not yet.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 2s;">
        When the food finally arrived, we ate with our hands — no spoons, no formality. Just comfort. Just real.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 2.5s;">
        I fed her a bite of biryani. She looked at me and fed me back. I swear... that was it. That was the moment I fell all over again.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text animated-hold" style="animation-delay: 3s;">
        After we finished, I went to wash hands. She dried hers… on my shirt. My favorite shirt. And somehow, it felt more like love than anything.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 3.5s;">
        She sat beside me while we waited for the bill. I shifted my chair back so she could lean. She tried to peek into the surprise bag again — I held it tighter, smiling.

      <h2 class="scene-title">🛣️ Ride to Muddebihal & The Surprise Gifts</h2>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 0.5s;">
        It was time to drop her back to Muddebihal. My heart was heavy... the kind of heavy that only comes when a beautiful day is ending.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 1s;">
        I placed the surprise bag in front of my bike, right on the petrol tank. And we started riding. Wind on our faces... memories behind us.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text highlight fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 1.5s;">
        For the first 10-15 km, I was holding the rose — fingers tight, heart tighter. I wanted the moment to be perfect.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 2s;">
        Finally, I turned slightly, handed her the roses on the moving bike. She gasped, smiled, held them like they were the most precious thing she’d ever received.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 2.5s;">
        Then came the KitKat — simple, sweet, just like her smile when I passed it over my shoulder.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 3s;">
        But the final gift… it wasn’t just a surprise. It was a memory, a promise I’d kept for a whole year.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text animated-hold" style="animation-delay: 3.5s;">
        A small bottle of nail polish — the exact shade she had once said she loved. A year ago. And I had saved it... just for this moment.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 4s;">
        She went silent. And I could feel her emotions melt into the wind. We didn’t speak — but everything was said.
      </p>
  
      <!-- 💞 Added Romantic Hand-Holding Moment -->
      <p class="scene-text highlight fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 4.5s;">
        Then, as the sun slowly dipped and the wind danced around us… I gently reached for her hand.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 5s;">
        I held her left hand with my left — riding the bike with just one hand, our fingers locked, hearts aligned.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 5.5s;">
        We stayed like that for the rest of the journey. Her hand in mine, warmth in our silence. That moment... was pure magic.

      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 0.5s;">
        I dropped her at Muddebihal, and we both sat quietly for a second — not wanting to leave, not ready to let go.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 1s;">
        We didn’t hug. We didn’t even take a selfie. It wasn’t because we didn’t want to — we just… didn’t know how to say goodbye.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text highlight fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 1.5s;">
        I kept waiting for her to ask. She kept waiting for me.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 2s;">
        Our hearts were heavy, our eyes said everything. And in that silence — we made a quiet promise to meet again.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 2.5s;">
        As I rode back alone… the wind felt colder, and every kilometer felt longer.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text animated-hold" style="animation-delay: 3s;">
        But even without a hug or a photo, that day lives forever in my heart — frame by frame, smile by smile.
      </p>
  
      <p class="scene-text fade-stagger" style="animation-delay: 3.5s;">
        And next time… we’ll hug a little tighter, smile a little longer, and never forget to click that one perfect picture 📸❤️
