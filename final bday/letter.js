  "There were days I felt completely lost â€” like I was drowning inside, but I still smiled for the world. Because deep down, I still had one hope â€” you.",
  
  "I waited, I broke, I healed a little, and then broke again. But I never gave up on you. Never once.",
  
  "Every time you looked away, I still looked for you. Every time you stayed silent, I still listened for your voice. Every time you drifted, I still held on tighter â€” even if it hurt.",
  
  "You were never just someone to me. You were the only one. I never needed grand moments. I only wanted you â€” your laugh, your tiny smiles, the way you said my nameâ€¦ those small things meant the world to me.",
  
  "And even today, when weâ€™re not the same, when I donâ€™t know what tomorrow looks likeâ€¦ I still carry every memory like a treasure.",
  
  "I donâ€™t know if weâ€™ll ever be what we used to be. But I do know this: Youâ€™ll always be a part of me â€” the part that felt everything deeply, the part that loved without asking anything back.",
